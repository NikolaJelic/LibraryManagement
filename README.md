# LibraryManagement
This is a program for managing private libraries or large boog collections.
Every book has a Title, Author, Genre, Description and an option to check if it is read or not and if it is lent or not.

The user can also add a cover picture to each book, sort the books by authors or genres, search by title and export the enitre book list to pdf.

This is the first bigger project I made that I can consider decently complete and it served as a great learning experience.
